## Features

* Performance (> 680,000 commands per second using pipeline on a MacBook Air with a single client thread)
* Pipelining
* Transactions
* LUA Scripting
* All string commands
* All hash commands
* All list commands
* All set commands
* All hyperloglog commands
* All commands for bit operations
* All sorted set commands
* Publish/subscribe


## Installation

Add it to your `shard.yml`:

```crystal
dependencies:
  redis:
    github: stefanwille/crystal-redis
    version: ~> 1.5.2
```

and then install the library into your project:

```bash
$ crystal deps
```


## Required Crystal Version

This library needs Crystal version >= 0.14.2.


## Usage

Require the package:

```crystal
  require "redis"
```

then

```crystal
  redis = Redis.new
```

Then you can call Redis commands on the `redis` object:

```crystal
  redis.set("foo", "bar")
  redis.get("foo")
```

## Examples

To get started, see the examples:

* There is a separate git repository [crystal-redis-examples](https://github.com/stefanwille/crystal-redis-examples) with examples.
* start with this [basic example](https://github.com/stefanwille/crystal-redis-examples/blob/master/src/basic.cr)
* look at [the other examples](https://github.com/stefanwille/crystal-redis-examples/blob/master/src/)
* the [spec](https://github.com/stefanwille/crystal-redis/blob/master/spec/redis.cr) contains even more usage examples


## Documentation

* [API documentation](http://stefanwille.github.io/crystal-redis/doc/) -
start reading it at the class `Redis`.
* [Redis commands documentation](http://redis.io/commands) - the original Redis documentation is necessary, as the API documentation above is just a quick reference
* [Redis documentation page](http://redis.io/documentation) - general information about Redis and its concepts


## Performance

I have benchmarked Crystal-Redis against several other client libraries in various programming languages in this [blog article](http://www.stefanwille.com/2015/05/redis-clients-crystal-vs-ruby-vs-c-vs-go/).

Here are some results:

* Crystal: With this library I get > 680,000 commands per second using pipeline on a MacBook Air with a single client thread.

* C: The equivalent program written in C with Hiredis gets me 340,000 commands per second.

* Ruby: Ruby 2.2.1 with the [redis-rb](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb) and Hiredis driver handles 150,000 commands per second.

[Read more results](http://www.stefanwille.com/2015/05/redis-clients-crystal-vs-ruby-vs-c-vs-go/) for Go, Java, Node.js.


## Status

I have exercised every API method in the spec and built some example programs. There is no production use yet.

I took great care to make this library very usable with respect to API, reliability and documentation.
